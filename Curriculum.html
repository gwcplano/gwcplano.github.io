       <h1> What Will I Learn? </h1>
       
       <p>
            Our curriculum is designed for students with a wide range of computer science experience. We have activities for girls with ZERO computer science experience all the way up to activities that introduce college-level concepts. The broad set of soft and hard skills we teach are: 
            
        <ul>
            <h4>Social skills:</h4>
           <li>Teamwork</li>
           <li>Confidence</li>
           <li>Time Management</li>
           <li>Communication</li>
            
            <h4>Programming skills:</h4>
           <li>Functions</li>
           <li>Variables</li>
           <li>Conditionals</li>
           <li>Loops</li>
        </ul>
            
            As a central part of your Clubs experience, you will work with your Club on a Computer Science Impact Project, where you will use computer science to solve a problem relevant to your Club and community. Through this project, you will also learn the Core4 computer science concepts that form the basis for all computer programming languages while also building your teamwork and leadership skills.

       <h3> Level 1 Class: </h3>
       
       <p>Girls Who Code's curriculum in the level one class definitely challenges its students, however the class suits programmers with a small computer science background or no programming background at all. In this beginner's class, the curriculum introduces students to a number of programming languages. Starting with a basic programming language, Scratch, then continuing with Javascript, Arduino, HTML/CSS, and Python. After instructors teach different programming material, students create their own projects such as, video games, apps, and websites.</p>
