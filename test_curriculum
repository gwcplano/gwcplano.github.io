       <h1> The Girls Who Code Experience: </h1>
       
       <p>
            The Girls Who Code program designed its curriculum for students with wide-ranging computer science experiences. The program's classes involve students in numerous activites; suiting girls with ZERO or minimal programming experience, but also suiting advanced students ready for college level concepts. Girls will learn a variety of concepts; from social skills to the four core programming skills. </p> 
            
        <ul>
            <h4>Social skills:</h4>
           <li>Teamwork</li>
           <li>Confidence</li>
           <li>Time Management</li>
           <li>Communication</li>
           <li>Leadership</li>
            
            <h4>Programming skills:</h4>
           <li>Functions</li>
           <li>Variables</li>
           <li>Conditionals</li>
           <li>Loops</li>
        </ul>
            
    <p> As a central part of each Club's experience, girls collaborate as a team on a Computer Science Impact Project, effectively using their computer science knowledge to solve important problems in their community. Through this project, students learn the Core4 computer science concepts that form the basis for all computer programming languages, while also building teamwork and leadership skills. </p>
       
       <h1> AwesomeMath Academy Curriculum: </h1>
       
       <h1> Level 1 Class: </h1>
       
       <p>Girls Who Code's curriculum in the level one class definitely challenges its students, however the class suits programmers with a small computer science background or no programming background at all. In this beginner's class, the curriculum introduces students to a number of programming languages. Starting with the basic programming language of Scratch, then continuing with Javascript, Arduino, HTML/CSS, and Python. After instructors teach different programming material, students create their own projects such as, artistoc designs, video games, apps, and websites.</p>
       
       <h1> Level 2 Class: </h1>
           
       <p>The level two class continues covering concepts learned in the level one class but at a more andvanced level, expecting students to understand the four main programming concepts. Although girls will not continue with a very basic programming language such as scratch, they might continue learning about Javascript, Arduino HTML/CSS, and Python. Students will definitely participate in projects like, video games, apps, and websites, however they might also participate in competitions.</p>
